              Rooted in generations of shea butter craftsmanship, OurShea was
              founded in 2024 as an eco-conscious producer of premium organic
              shea butter. Based in northern Ghana and in partnership with the
              Bongo Soe Shea Butter Women Group, we process shea butter for
              local and international markets—creating jobs, supporting women,
              and protecting the environment. Blessed with abundant sunshine,
              our region provides the perfect climate for cultivating
              high-quality shea nuts.
            </p>
            <p className="mt-4">
              From traditional methods to innovative agile practices, we blend
              heritage and technology to meet global demand for ethically
              sourced skincare ingredients. We are more than a manufacturer.
              OurShea transforms shea waste into smokeless charcoal briquettes,
              helping reduce deforestation and promote clean household energy.

            <p className="mt-4">
              Our product line includes handcrafted soaps, bulk shea butter for
              cosmetic companies, and smokeless charcoal—all produced with
              environmental and social responsibility at heart.
